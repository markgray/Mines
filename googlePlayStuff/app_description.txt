This version of the Mine Sweeper game is a lot like the classic version: you are presented with a grid holding Mined sectors and Safe sectors and you have to correctly mark each sector as "SAFE" or "MINE". Safe sectors once marked display the number of their closest neighbors that have a Mine from 0 to 8. There are several differences: since phones do not have a left and right mouse button there are "SAFE" and "MINE" buttons at the bottom of the screen that you toggle to determine whether clicking a sector in the grid marks it as "SAFE" or "MINE", and my version also allows you to cheat because it will allow you to change a sector you wrongly guessed to be "SAFE" to a "MINE" sector and it will not allow you to mark a "SAFE" sector as a "MINE" sector. Classic Mine Sweeper game purists can instead push the back button to start a new game when they make these mistakes, but personally I prefer it this way. Once the user correctly marks all sectors as "SAFE" or "MINE" you move to the History screen which displays the latest game results as well as the results of all previous games you have played. Once on the History screen you can long click on one of the old games and replay it if you feel like it.
